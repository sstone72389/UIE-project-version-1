## Purpose of this repo

This repo was created to illustrate the value of creating a CSS grid system framework as an alternative to the bootstrap library. Built with just HTML and CSS, this framework allows for a fully responsive web app without requiring a CDN or installing local dependencies. 

## Some of the benefits of building your own custom framework are:

* No reliance on libraries loading to ensure responsive design
* Can be easily customized for use on various applications
* Avoids unnecessary code/unused features of frameworks
* Full control over the code and its design implementation
* Complete modularity: flexibility of framework depends on individual needs
* A unified code base: minimize the need of third party components

Bootstrap is a great tool, but sometimes all that's needed is a responsive grid system. Many users barely scratch the surface of built in features for the various framework utilized. This framework was used as a basis for creating and implementing a CSS grid system with out all of the unused bells and whistles included on pre-existent frameworks.
